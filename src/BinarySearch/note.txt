Rule of Thumb for left and right
1. Finding a Minimum Feasible Value (Smallest Satisfying Value):

 -Left will contain the answer.
 -Use while (left < right) or while (left <= right).
 -Example: Finding the smallest x such that a condition is satisfied (find smallest x).

2. Finding a Maximum Feasible Value (Largest Satisfying Value):

 -Right will contain the answer.
 -Use while (left <= right).
 -Example: Finding the largest x such that a condition is satisfied (find largest x).
